Next attention was turned towards the left [pelvic brim](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/pelvis) where the [sigmoid colon](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22134-colon-large-intestine) was mobilized off the [abdominal sidewall](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21755-abdominal-muscles) from its [adhesions](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15254-abdominal-adhesions) using a combination of cold sharp [dissection](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002349.htm) and blunt dissection and judicious [monopolar energy](https://www.aspensurgical.com/Resources/Documents/Articles/bipolar-electrosurgery-vs-monopolar-electrosurgery). Attention was then turned toward the right [pelvic brim](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/pelvis). The [adhesions](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/15254-abdominal-adhesions) to the [small bowel](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22135-small-intestine) were lysed off the [abdominal sidewall](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/21755-abdominal-muscles) using a combination of cold sharp [dissection](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/002349.htm) and blunt dissection and judicious [monopolar energy](https://www.aspensurgical.com/Resources/Documents/Articles/bipolar-electrosurgery-vs-monopolar-electrosurgery).

Next was turned towards the right [hydrosalpinx](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24437-hydrosalpinx). Using [monopolar](https://www.aspensurgical.com/Resources/Documents/Articles/bipolar-electrosurgery-vs-monopolar-electrosurgery) shears and [bipolar energy](https://www.aspensurgical.com/Resources/Documents/Articles/bipolar-electrosurgery-vs-monopolar-electrosurgery), the [hydrosalpinx](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24437-hydrosalpinx) was dissected from the [mesosalpinx](https://www.imaios.com/en/e-anatomy/anatomical-structures/mesosalpinx-1541222256#) taking care to avoid injury to the right [ovary](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22999-ovaries) and [IP ligament](https://www.imaios.com/en/e-anatomy/anatomical-structures/suspensory-ligament-of-left-ovary-infundibulopelvic-ligament-female-121132432#). The [hydrosalpinx](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/24437-hydrosalpinx) was removed from the [abdominal cavity](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22894-peritoneum) under direct [laparoscopic](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/procedures/4819-laparoscopy) visualization.

### 🌟 Patient-Friendly Version

#### 🏥 What Happened
> 🔊 **[Select Text to Listen with Audio]**

The doctor worked on the left side of your lower belly, carefully separating your intestine from scar tissue that was stuck to your belly wall. They used special tools to cut and gently push the scar tissue away, plus a small electrical tool to safely remove it. Then they did the same thing on the right side.

Next, they found a Fallopian Tube filled with fluid on your right side. They carefully removed this Fallopian Tube using special tools, making sure not to hurt your ovary or nearby body parts. The fluid-filled Fallopian Tube was completely taken out.

#### 🎯 Next Steps

Your medical team will watch how you're healing and tell you what to do. You'll need to rest and eat certain foods to help your body get better.

#### 🌈 What to Expect
> 🔊 **[Select Text to Listen with Audio]**

You might feel some pain as your body heals from the surgery. Your doctors will talk to you about ways to manage the pain and what activities are safe for you to do while you recover.
